            <p>
                Objective: The aim of the project was to develop a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) using
                React, adhering to the principles of test-driven development (TDD). The application was designed to
                leverage the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.
            </p>


            <p>
                Methodology: The project followed a test-driven development approach, ensuring robustness and
                reliability in the application's codebase. React was chosen as the framework for front-end development,
                allowing for efficient UI rendering and component-based architecture. The serverless architecture was
                adopted to promote scalability and cost-effectiveness, with cloud functions handling backend operations.
            </p>


            <p>
                Key Findings:

                Successfully implemented a serverless architecture using cloud functions for backend operations.
                Developed a responsive and performant PWA using React, enabling seamless user experience across devices.
                Integrated the Google Calendar API to fetch and display upcoming events within the application.
                Utilized test-driven development to ensure code quality and reliability, resulting in a more
                maintainable codebase.
            </p>

            <p>
                Challenges:

                Integrating the Google Calendar API required thorough understanding of OAuth2 authentication and API
                endpoints.
                Ensuring compatibility and responsiveness across various browsers and devices posed challenges during
                development and testing phases.
                Adhering to the principles of test-driven development sometimes led to slower initial progress but
                ultimately resulted in more robust code.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lessons Learned:

                Test-driven development proved to be instrumental in identifying and addressing potential issues early
                in the development process.
                Working with serverless architecture provided insights into its advantages in terms of scalability and
                cost-efficiency.
                Collaboration and communication among team members were crucial for the successful execution of the
                project.
            </p>

            <p>
                Future Recommendations:

                Explore additional features and integrations to enhance the functionality of the application.
                Continuously monitor and optimize the performance of the serverless architecture.
                Expand test coverage to include edge cases and enhance overall code resilience.
