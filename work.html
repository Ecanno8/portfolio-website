                <p>
                    Create a small web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that pulls data from an external
                    API, like the Pokémon API, to display a list of items. Users will be able to click on an item to see
                    detailed information, enhancing their experience. The app will feature clean CSS styling and adhere
                    to ESLint rules for well-formatted JavaScript. You’ll also implement a complex UI pattern, such as a
                    modal for details. Once completed, the app will be deployed on GitHub Pages and will work across
                    major browsers, including IE11. For added polish, you might include loading indicators and
                    user-friendly error messages.

                <h2>Meet App</h2>
                <p>
                    Create a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) using React, with a strong focus on
                    test-driven development (TDD). The app will fetch events from the Google Calendar API, allowing
                    users to filter events by city, see visualized data, and even use it offline. With AWS Lambda
                    handling authorization and a mobile-friendly design, users will be able to add your app to their
                    home screen. You're aiming for 90% test coverage and will ensure it meets PWA standards, deploying
                    the final version on GitHub Pages. It’s a sleek and efficient project built for both performance and
                    usability!

                <h2>Movie API</h2>
                <p> Explore the server-side of a movie web app that lets users explore a wide range of movies,
                    directors, and genres.
                    You'll be enabling features like user registration, profile updates, and the ability to create and
                    manage a list of favorite movies. With Node.js, Express, and MongoDB powering the backend, you'll
                    also be handling important tasks like authentication, authorization, and data validation. Plus,
                    you'll be deploying the API to Heroku and testing it in Postman to ensure everything runs smoothly.
                    It's an exciting project that'll give users a rich experience with movie data!</p>

                <h2>Client-side programming & React </h2>
                <p>Dive into the client-side of your myFlix app using React, where you'll bring the user experience to
                    life! Building off the server-side API you previously developed, you’ll create views where users can
                    browse all movies, search for specific titles, and get detailed info on films, directors, and
                    genres. With Bootstrap for styling and Parcel for bundling, the app will be a sleek single-page
                    experience (SPA). You'll also give users the ability to sign up, log in, update their profiles, and
                    manage favorite movies. Adding React Redux for state management, especially for filtering, will make
                    the app feel dynamic and responsive. It’s going to be a fantastic project that ties everything
                    together for a smooth movie discovery experience!</p>

                    database you developed. Users will be able to sign up, log in, and browse through a collection of
                    movies, with options to explore more details about each film, its director, and genre. The app will
                    be styled with Angular Material for a smooth and responsive user experience. You’ll also ensure the
                    code is well-documented using Typedoc and JSDoc, making it easier to maintain. Once completed, your
                    project will be hosted on GitHub Pages, ready for users to explore.</p>

                <h2>Mobile Chat App </h2>
                <p> Develop a chat app using React Native and Expo that focuses on user-friendly communication
                    features like sending messages, images, and sharing location data. Users can customize their chat
                    experience by choosing a background color before joining, and offline storage ensures chats are
                    always accessible. Firebase handles anonymous authentication and stores conversations and images,
                    while location data is sent via map views. Accessibility is key, with screen reader support for
                    users with visual impairments. The Gifted Chat library will provide a smooth interface, bringing
                    your chat app to life!</p>
